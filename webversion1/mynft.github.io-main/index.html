                    Welcome to Fortuna's Wheel, a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to participate in a monthly lottery event on the Abitrum chain. Inspired by the myth of Fortuna, the goddess of fortune and luck, Fortuna's Wheel brings prosperity and good luck to players through the exciting and unpredictable nature of the lottery.</p>
                    <img src="images/team/main22.svg" class="nft-img">
                  <p>To participate in Fortuna's Wheel, users can purchase a lottery ticket for $50. The sales period for tickets runs for one month, giving players ample time to purchase tickets and join the drawing. At the end of the sales period, a smart contract will randomly select 10 winners from all the ticket holders using a secure and transparent process. The winners will be announced and the smart contract will distribute 50% of the funds raised from ticket sales to them equally.

                    <p>
                      Long ago in a great realm, the great goddess Fortuna held a monthly lottery event in her hallowed halls. She had 200 guardians, each representing one of the 200 unique NFTs, to oversee the transparency and fairness of the event. These guardians were charged with the duty of protecting the integrity of the event and ensuring that all participants had an equal chance of winning.

To enter Fortuna's realm and participate in the event, one had to acquire a ticket. The more tickets one acquired, the greater the chances of winning. The tickets were sold for a small price, and the proceeds from the sales were used to fund the event and reward the guardians for their hard work.</p>
                      <img src="images/newr5.jpeg" class="nft-img">
                    <p>On the day of the event, the hall was filled with excitement as the smart contract selected the winners at random. Fortuna blessed the winners with wealth and prosperity, and the guardians were rewarded with a portion of the proceeds from the event.

                      The guardians were thrilled to be a part of such a prestigious and fair event, and they were grateful to the goddess Fortuna for the opportunity to serve and protect the integrity of the lottery. They knew that by participating in the event, they were helping to bring prosperity and good luck to all those who entered Fortuna's realm.
