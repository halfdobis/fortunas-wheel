// In ancient times, when the world was young and full of mystery, there was a great goddess named Fortuna. She was the goddess of luck, fate, and fortune, and her power was said to be beyond measure. People from all over the world would pray to her, hoping for her blessings to bring them wealth and prosperity.

// One day, Fortuna had a vision. In her vision, she saw that the people of the world were suffering. They were struggling to make ends meet, and they had lost hope in the future. They had stopped believing in the power of luck and fate, and they had turned away from her blessings.

// Fortuna was deeply saddened by what she saw, and she knew that something had to be done. She thought long and hard about how she could help the people of the world regain their faith in her power, and finally, she came up with a plan.

// She would create a game, a game that would be steeped in the mystical and ancient traditions of her power. It would be a game that would allow people to experience the thrill of luck and fate, and to feel the power of her blessings once again.

// And so, she forged the game Divinedraw. She recruited 100 guardians, handpicked by her, to ensure the transparency and fairness of the game. The guardians were tasked with overseeing the game and ensuring that it was conducted in a fair and unbiased manner.

// For the first time, people would have a chance to be a shareholder in a lottery game. By becoming a guardian, they could own an income-generating NFT that would entitle them to a share of the profits. And with the introduction of new ticket purchase options and the expansion to more blockchain platforms, the game would become more accessible and reach a wider audience.

// Fortuna's plan was a success. People from all over the world began to play Divinedraw, and they felt the power of her blessings once again. They regained their faith in her power, and they started to believe in the magic of luck and fate.

// And so, the game of Divinedraw continues to this day, allowing people to experience the thrill of luck and fortune, and to feel the power of the great goddess Fortuna's blessings.
